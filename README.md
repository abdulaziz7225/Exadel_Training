### The platform for cleaning companies and users

1) You can register as a company or a regular user
2) An **ordinary user** can _create a request for the services_ of cleaning companies on the platform. Be sure to specify the _parameters_:
    - Address (country, city, street, house number, apartment);
    - _Filters by companies_ (the user can set filters for which companies will receive a notification based on the rating or mark specific companies in the list of
    companies);
    - Total area;
    - After clicking on the create button. A request for services appears in the system, which is _available only to cleaning companies_ and is _filtered by a custom filter._
3) **Cleaning companies** _receive notifications about a new request_, they can come up with an _offer to a specific user_, and the **user** can _choose from the list of offers_ who to
work with
4) The cost of services will be calculated from n * s where n is the cost of an hour of work of a particular company and s is the user-specified area. The **company** indicates the cost of an hour of work at the time of registration and may
change in the future.
5) All **companies** must have a 5-star rating system
6) The **user** can_ leave reviews_ about a particular company
